"""One place that knows a shell command's head is not its first character.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (Aletheia F70 shape, named 2026-08-18).

Three separate sites in this repo have independently learned that
``VAR=1 divineos correction`` and ``divineos correction`` are the same
command wearing different clothes, and each learned it by shipping a
matcher that got it wrong first:

  - 2026-07-25, the verify-before-build signal: substring-matching the raw
    text, which false-fired on ``--command "divineos decide"`` as an
    argument. Aria's review. Fixed with ``_resolve_command_head``.
  - 2026-07-31, F107: ``cd X && divineos Y`` rejected while bare
    ``divineos Y`` passed.
  - 2026-08-18, the shared remedy allowlist: a leading env assignment made
    a gate's own prescribed remedy invisible to the list that keeps the
    gate's door open, so the compass marker blocked ``compass-ops observe``
    and then blocked the edit that would repair it.

The third one is mine, and I wrote it while repairing a duplicate-resolver
bug in the token gauge, in the same commit that says the resolver lives in
one place now. The correct implementation was already here. Measured, the
version I hand-rolled missed three of five cases this one handles —
including a quoted value with a space, which I wrote up as a known limit
rather than checking whether anyone had solved it.

So: the stripping lives here, once, and both the Python gate and the bash
allowlist call it. Adding a fourth site means importing this, not writing
a fourth loop.

# 2026-08-19 (Aletheia F114). A caller that must run a QUOTE-AWARE check on what
# is left after the prefixes cannot use stripped_command(): that re-joins shlex
# tokens, which drops the quoting. A semicolon inside an evidence string comes
# back out naked, so a chain-shape check on the re-joined text would reject a
# perfectly legitimate remedy.

# So this returns the ORIGINAL TEXT with only the leading prefixes removed,
# byte-for-byte from the first real token onward.
# 2026-08-19, SECOND PASS. The first version of the cd pattern accepted any
# non-space run as the directory, and a quoted directory as any characters at
# all. That is weaker than the bespoke _CD_PREFIX_RE it was meant to replace,
# whose comment records it as the tactical block on an actual exploit -- and I
# only found out by testing the two against each other instead of assuming the
# shared one was the better one because it was the shared one.

# to the chain check, and the gate returned SAFE. The substitution never got
# looked at because it had already been thrown away.

# the quoted or the unquoted form. Same exclusions as _CD_PREFIX_RE.

# SHELL-OPTION PREFIX (Andrew 2026-08-28). One gate teaches the habit of
# prefixing commands with `set -o pipefail;` -- because a pipeline reports the
# exit code of its LAST stage, so a failing command piped into `tail` arrives
# as success. Other gates reject any command containing a chain character,
# because `remedy && rm -rf ~` must never be exempt. Both rules are correct.
# Together they deadlocked me out of three remedies at once, each gate refusing
# the exact command its own message told me to run.
#
# The reach was to loosen the chain check. Andrew's answer was better and is
# what is built here: "why not automate it or run it through something that
# removes the prefix if you add it." Strip the inert prefix, then apply the
# strict check UNCHANGED to what remains. Nothing is widened -- a `set` that
# passes this pattern can only enable shell options.
#
# The pattern accepts option flags and `-o <name>` pairs ONLY. No paths, no
# substitutions, no operators. So what is removed provably cannot execute
# anything, and any real chain survives into the returned string exactly as
# the `cd` prefix note above describes: `set -o pipefail; divineos learn "x"
# && rm -rf ~` still returns text containing `&& rm -rf ~` and is still caught.
# The `o` flag takes a name, and it is commonly CLUSTERED -- `set -euo pipefail`
# is the same thing as `set -e -u -o pipefail`. The clustered form was missing
# from the first version of this pattern and the test for it failed, which is
# the only reason it is here: `-euo` matched as a plain flag and `pipefail` was
# then a bare word the pattern could not account for, so the whole prefix went
# unrecognised and the deadlock stayed shut for the commonest spelling of it.
# Still options-only either way -- the trailing word is reachable only when the
# flag cluster actually contains an `o`.
