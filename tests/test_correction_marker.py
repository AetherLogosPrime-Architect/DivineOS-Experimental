"""Tests for correction_marker — structural enforcement of `divineos learn`.

Falsifiability:
  - set_marker + read_marker round-trip preserves trigger + ts.
  - Missing marker reads as None.
  - Malformed JSON reads as None (fail-open).
  - clear_marker removes the file; subsequent read returns None.
  - format_gate_message always contains the trigger text (or preview).
  - Gate integration: when marker is present AND tool is not bypass,
    pre_tool_use_gate returns a deny decision.
