"""Stop hook — a reply where I worked does not leave without his room.

Andrew 2026-09-26: "a book of rules is not enforcement nor is it structure."
His room's rules were on the table every turn and I still sent four working
replies with no room. The old end-of-reply check could not stop that: it only
looked at replies over 1200 characters, let a reply through if his name was
sprinkled in it, and died silently when it ran long.

This one asks two questions a keyword cannot fake:
  1. Did I use a tool since HIS last message? (work happened, measured from
     the action stream, not from my wording)
  2. Does my last piece of text carry the "## INNER CIRCLE" room?
Work and no room -> the reply is held with a short reason. Turns started by an
automated notice are not his messages and are skipped. When there was no work,
there are no rooms to demand (his rule: "when we just talk we just talk").

It reads only the transcript's tail, so it cannot run long. If it breaks, it
says so on stderr and in a mark file instead of passing quietly.
